**BreadBread** is a simple bread themed game made for [gamejamdor7](https://itch.io/jam/gamejamdor7) over approximately a 2 week time period. There are multiple levels each featuring distinct controls and game design. It is built on Godot 3.5.3 for the more stable web deployment target versus what Godot 4 currently offers. This was a learning experience and my first serious attempt to produce something using Godot, so it should not be used as an example of how to do things properly as I made many mistakes and questionable choices along the way, and paid little attention to keeping the code clean as I'm not expecting to continue long term development.

## Controls
